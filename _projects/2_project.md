[SCOTUS-FI](https://scotusfi.com/) is a fun website for any casual follower of the US Supreme Court. I was inspired by the [lofi beats to study/relax to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lofi_Girl) and decided to create a spinoff of the popular audio stream. 

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/scotusfi_menu.png" title="scotusfi menu" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Use a drop-down menu to select from various Supreme Court Oral Arguments.
</div>

The website runs on a simple javascript web app with royalty free lofi music options.
